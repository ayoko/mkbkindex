## News

Tool named 'shiftindex' has been added in the directory utils today.
This is a helper utility to **patch** an already generated index manuscript.
Now, we can adjust page numbers in a range, of an index, forward or backward!
Simple tool but many thanks from professional publishing editors.

Document is also available in utils/shiftindex.md.

An example input/output is shown in https://github.com/ayoko/mkbkindex/blob/master/examples/input.txt .  It is the easiest way to understand this tool.
